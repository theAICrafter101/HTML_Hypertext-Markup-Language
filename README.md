# HTML_Hypertext-Markup-Language

Built a simple web app to show details about the cat (the lovely animal).

What I gained from this:
- Understand the boilerplate of HTML.
- Come to know about the different sections of an HTML document:  html, head, body, etc.
- Grasp the attributes and tags used in HTML head and body.
- Learn how to convert an image or text into a link.
- and learn how to attach an image or a link to HTML.
