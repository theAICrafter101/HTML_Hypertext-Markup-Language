# HTML_Hypertext-Markup-Language

## HTML Essentials
- Defines the structure and content of web pages.
- Elements are the building blocks; most have opening + closing tags.
- Void elements have no closing tag (e.g., img, meta).
- Attributes provide extra info or behavior (attribute="value").
- Boolean attributes: true when present (e.g., disabled, required).
- Comments allow developer notes, not shown in the browser.

## Common Elements
- Headings: h1–h6 (importance decreases downward).
- Paragraphs: p for text blocks.
- Images: img uses src and alt (text description).
- Body: Contains all visible page content.
- Sectioning: section for thematic blocks; div as a non-semantic container.
- Links: a uses href to navigate.
- Lists: ul (bulleted) and ol (numbered), each with li items.
- Text emphasis: em (emphasis), strong (strong importance).
- figure + figcaption: groups media with a caption.
- main: primary content area.
- footer: bottom area for site info and links.

## Identifiers & Grouping
- ID: Unique per page; no spaces; use hyphens for multiple words.
- Class: Reusable grouping identifier; elements may have multiple classes.

## Special Characters & Linking
- HTML entities: Escape reserved characters (e.g., &amp;, &lt;).
- link element: Connects external stylesheets or icons.
- script element: Embeds JavaScript or references external JS via src.

## Boilerplate & Encoding
- DOCTYPE: Declares the HTML standard.
- html: Root element; lang defines page language.
- head: Metadata for browsers/search engines.
- meta: Defines metadata (character encoding, previews, etc.).
- title: Browser tab title.
- UTF‑8: Universal character encoding set via meta charset.

## SEO & Social Sharing
- SEO: Improving visibility on search engines.
- Meta description: Short page summary.
- Open Graph (OG) tags: Control how pages appear on social media (title, type, image, URL).

## Media Elements & Optimization
- Replaced elements: Content from external sources (e.g., iframe, video).
- Images: Optimize size, format, compression. Prefer WEBP or AVIF.
- Licenses: Check copyright/Creative Commons before use.
- SVG: Scales without losing quality.

## Multimedia Integration
- audio/video: Supports multiple formats (audio: mp3/wav/ogg; video: mp4/webm).
- controls: Shows playback UI.
- loop/muted: Boolean attributes for behavior.
- source elements: Provide multiple file types for browser compatibility.
- poster: Image shown before the video plays.

## Target Attribute Types
- _self: current tab (default)
- _blank: new tab
- _parent: parent frame
- _top: top-most browsing context

## Paths
- Path basics: / (separator), . (current), .. (parent).
- Absolute path: Full URL including protocol + domain.
- Relative path: Based on current file location; ideal for internal links.

## Link States
- :link – unvisited link
- :visited – visited link
- :hover – mouse pointer over link
- :focus – keyboard or programmatic focus
- :active – during click/activation
